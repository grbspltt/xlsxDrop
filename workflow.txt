1. User drops an excel file that gets converted to JSON and saved in
   tempAcpDrop.
2. After successfully inserting the raw data. Route calls tempAcpDrop.convert().
   This step converts the data to the correct format, and writes the output to
   importAcpConverted.
3. After conversion, route calls acp.toHist() on acp, which moves all data from
   acp to acpHist, then clears the collection by calling acp.clear().
